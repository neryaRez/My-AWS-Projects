# üõ°Ô∏è Private EC2 Instance with SSM Access via VPC Endpoints Only

This AWS CloudFormation project provisions a secure EC2 instance within a **private subnet**, completely isolated from the internet. The instance is remotely managed **exclusively via AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** using **VPC Interface Endpoints**, without any NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway.

---

## üß≠ Architecture Overview

- **VPC CIDR**: 10.0.0.0/16
- **Subnet**: 10.0.1.0/24 (Private only)
- **No Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway**
- **SSM Access via Interface VPC Endpoints**
- **S3 Access via Gateway Endpoint**
- **EC2 instance with IAM role allowing S3 and SSM**

## üîí Security Model

- No public IP is assigned.
- No Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway is used.
- All communication with AWS services (SSM, S3) occurs through **private VPC endpoints**.
- The EC2's security group allows:
  - Inbound HTTPS (443) from within the VPC.
  - Outbound HTTPS to any destination.

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Save the template as `private-ec2-vpce.yaml`.
2. Deploy using AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation create-stack \
     --stack-name PrivateEC2ViaSSM \
     --template-body file://private-ec2-vpce.yaml \
     --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
